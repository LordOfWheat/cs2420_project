1. Create a base dynamic list class (list.h)
	- contains most necessary functions
2. Create a hangman class (hang.h)
	- might not be necessary
	- could help store stuff
3. Write the game in the main code
	- use the classes for storing

Things to store:
	20 words
	State of hangman
	Letters in selected word
	Correct letters
	Incorrect letters
	Total letters in the alphabet (probably not necessary)
